# Description

Gosling is a protocol and reference library implementation of said protocol. The protocol enables building peer-to-peer applications over the tor network whereby each node's connection has the following properties:

- **anonymous:** the real identity of a node is hidden using tor onion services
- **secure:** all network traffic is end-to-end encrypted by virtue of using tor and tor onion services
- **private+meta-data resistant:** nodes have fine control over their visibility/online-status to other nodes

It is meant to generalize (and improve upon) the authentication scheme [Ricochet-Refresh](https://github.com/blueprint-freespeech/ricochet-refresh) clients use to verify to each other. Details can be found in the protocol specification here:

- [Gosling Protocol](./docs/gosling_protocol/protocol.md)


## Dependencies

Libgosling currently has the following build dependencies:

- rust >= [1.61.0](https://github.com/blueprint-freespeech/gosling/blob/main/source/gosling/Cargo.toml#L6)
- cargo
- cmake >= [3.16.6](https://github.com/blueprint-freespeech/gosling/blob/main/source/CMakeLists.txt#L1)

Cargo will automatically download and build the required Rust crates. The list of current dependencies can be found in [Cargo.toml](https://github.com/blueprint-freespeech/gosling/blob/main/source/gosling/Cargo.toml)

The C++ functional tests additionally depend on:

- boost >= [1.66](https://github.com/blueprint-freespeech/gosling/blob/main/source/test/functional/CMakeLists.txt#L1)

The documentation has the following build dependencies:

- [plantuml](https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml)
- [tidy](https://github.com/htacg/tidy-html5)

## Building

The reference implementation is a work-in-progress and the API is not yet fully stable.

You will need to initialize the git submodules by:

```
$ git submodule update --init
```

All of the usual cmake build types can be generated by invoking `make` from the `out` directory:

- **Debug** - No optimization, asserts enabled, debug symbols
- **MinSizeRel** - Optimize for size, no asserts, no symbols
- **Release** - Optimize for speed, no asserts, no symbols
- **RelWithDebInfo** - Optimize for speed, no asserts, debug symbols

Further information can be found in the cmake documentation:
- https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.16/variable/CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.html

From within one of the generated target directories, the projects may be built by:

```
$ make
```

and tests may then by run by:

```
$ make test
```
