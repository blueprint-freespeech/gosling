# Gosling Protocol v1.0.0

The Gosling protocol allows for the creation of Tor onion-service based peer-to-peer (onion-to-onion) applications. Initial inspiration came from the Ricochet instant messenger's peer-to-peer onion service architecture. Improvements have been made and some privacy issues have been addressed and fixed.

It is assumed that the reader is familiar with onion routing[^1], Tor[^2], and onion services (aka hidden services)[^3]. For the purposes of this document, Ricochet and Ricochet Refresh are used interchangeably when referring to properties or guarantees common to both applications.

## Overview

The purpose of Gosling is to standardize a privacy-preserving architecture for peer-to-peer applications on the Tor network between **nodes**.

- **Node** - A peer in a service-specific Gosling peer-to-peer network.

Each node has three components: a **client**, an **identity server**, and at least one **endpoint server**. A node can simultaneously have all three components running at the same time on a single computer, or each component could be split across multiple real computers on the tor network. A node is primarily identified by the onion-service id of its identity server.

  - **Client**  - A **node's** component making an outgoing connection to another **node**
  - **Identity Server** - A **node's** onion-service which listens for requests coming from **clients** who have never connected before that wish to become 'friends'. The **identity server** and a **client** perform a handshake and exchange information required to reach the **node's** **endpoint server(s)**. An **identity server** may serve multiple endpoint applications.
  - **Endpoint Server** - A **node's** onion-service(s) which listen for connections coming from **clients**. The route to this server is protected with onion service client authorization[^4], so only trusted Gosling **clients** are able to connect. A **node** may have multiple simultaneous **endpoint servers** (each with a different onion-service id), as tor only supports a finite number of authorized clients per onion service.

  For some applications, it may make sense to provide each authorized client their own onion service while for others, it may make more sense to batch clients together on a single onion service.

For the rest of this document we'll use instant messenger term **contact**.

- **Contact** - a Gosling **node** that has successfully completed the authentication handshake with another **node's** **identity server** and is allowed to connect to said **node's** **endpoint server**.

### Background

The above architecture is informed by our experience with and the limitations of Ricochet's architecture.

Ricochet only uses a single onion service. The service id of this onion service is used as your Ricochet ID for connecting to and chatting with other Ricochet users.

This simple architecture has some drawbacks:

#### Poor visibility control to contacts

Though not supported by the Ricochet front-end, in theory if one wanted to appear 'offline' while still being able to chat to your friends, they could disable their onion service and only make outgoing connections their friends. However, this must be done for *all* friends at once.

**Gosling's Solution:** Gosling allows finer-grained visibility controls:

- If a **node** does not wish to receive new contact requests, they can simply not run their **identity server**. Your existing allowed contacts are still be able to connect to the user's **endpoint server(s)** which are not publicly advertised.

- If a user wishes to appear offline to *all* **contacts**, they can disable their **endpoint server(s)**. A user may still selectively connect to their **contacts** by acting solely as a **client**.

#### Cyber-stalking

As a side-effect of Ricochet's usage of a single onion service and the poor visibility controls, anybody who knows
your Ricochet ID can secretly track a your online status. This is because the onion service is necessarily public to receive new friend requests.

All a malicious actor needs to do is attempt to open a connection to the target's Ricochet onion service.
Periodically pinging a Ricochet user's advertised service id will give a nearly perfect profile for when the are and are not using Ricochet.

This has some serious privacy implications. If a user uses Ricochet as they would any other IM application (always on in the background), this will give a perfect profile of the target's computer+internet usage.

**Gosling's Solution:** Because of the above described visibility controls, users can control when they are visible to to unauthorized users by selectively running their **identity server**.

One could also imagine applications which forego using the **identity server** entirely, and instead allow users to exchange client authorization keys and endpoint servers offline (via QR codes for example).

**Note:** A Gosling node may still be cyber-stalked by a *previously* authenticated user if the node is configured to group together multiple **clients** in a single **endpoint server** (rather than handing out a unique **endpoint server** to each client).

## Gosling Handshakes

**Nodes** communicate with each other using a BSON-based RPC protocol[^5]. As described above, each **node** has two server components: an **identity server** and at least one **endpoint server**.

A **client** initially connects to an **identity server** to complete the identity handshake. The purpose of this handshake is to prove to the **identity server** that the connecting **client** controls all of the keys they claim to, and (if successful) to exchange credentials the **client** needs to access a **identity server's** associated **endpoint server**.

After a **client** connects to and successfully authenticates with an **endpoint server**, we exit the Gosling handshake state machine and the underlying TCP stream is handed off to the endpoint application.

All types used in these RPC calls are BSON[^6] types. Any type marked `binary` is specifically the 'Generic binary subtype' (`\x00`). Any type marked `document` is specifically a BSON document (an encoded set of key/value pairs).

Calling these functions out of order must result in an error being returned and the connection being closed.

  begin_handshake(string version,
                  string client_identity,
                  string endpoint) -> document

  send_response(binary client_cookie,
                binary client_identity_proof_signature,
                binary client_authorization_key,
                bool client_authorization_key_signbit,
                binary client_authorization_signature,
                document challenge_response) -> string;
}
```

### Endpoint Server

A **client** may connect an **endpoint server** multiple times by specifying different channel names. For example, a chat application may have concurrent 'messaging' and 'file transfer' channels.

#### Sequence Diagram

![endpoint handshake](endpoint_handshake.svg)

#### Endpoint Server RPC API

```c++
namespace gosling_endpoint {
  // Begins an identity handshake session.
  //
  // Parameters:
  // - string version : the requested version of the Gosling protocol to use
  // - string channel : the application channel the client wants to open; this
  //   value must be encodable as ASCII.
  //
  // return : on success, a document object with the following members
  // - binary server_cookie: 32 byte cookie randomly generated by the server
  //
  // An error is raised if an invalid version is provided.
  begin_handshake(string version,
                  string channel) -> document

  // Submits the client proof for server verification. If this function is called
  // before begin_handshake() an error is returned.
  //
  // Parameters:
  // - binary client_cookie : 32-byte cookie randomly generated by the client
  // - string client_identity : the client's identity server v3 onion service id
  // - binary client_identity_proof_signature : 64-byte ed25519 signature of the
  //   client proof, signed with the ed25519 private key used to generate the
  //   client's v3 onion service id (see 'Client Identity Proof Calculation and
  //   Verification')
  //
  // return : on success, returns an empty document
  //
  // An error is raised if any of the associated checks or signature verifications fail
  send_response(binary client_cookie,
                string client_identity,
                binary client_identity_proof_signature) -> document;
}
```

### Client Identity Proof Calculation and Verification

The proof signed by client is calculated as:

```
proof = domain_separator  +
        request           +
        client_service_id +
        server_service_id +
        hex_client_cookie +
        hex_server_cookie
```

The `+` operator here indicates concatenation with a null byte in-between. For example, `"a" + "b" + "c"` would be encoded as the byte array `['a', \x00, 'b', \x00, 'c']`.

Each of the parameters  must be representable as an ASCII string and do *not* include an implicit null-terminator. The parameters are defined as:

- `domain_separator` : an ASCII string; for the identity handshake, this string is `gosling-identity`; for the endpoint handshake, this string is `gosling-endpoint`
- `request` : an ASCII string; for the identity handshake, this string is the requested endpoint; for the endpoint handshake, this string is the requested channel
- `client_service_id` : an ASCII string; the base-32 encoded onion service id (without the ".onion" suffix) of the connecting client's identity server
- `server_service_id` : an ASCII string; the base-32 encoded onion service id (without the ".onion" suffix) of the connected server (ie: when connected to the identity server, the identity server's onion service id is used; when connected to an endpoint server, that endpoint server's onion service id is used)
- `client_cookie` : an ASCII string; the cryptographically-randomly generated 32-byte client cookie encoded as lower-case hexadecimal (0-9a-f)
- `server_cookie` : an ASCII string; the cryptographically-randomly generated 32-byte server cookie encoded as lower-case hexadecimal (0-9a-f)

A **client** proves its identity to a gosling server (both **identity** or **endpoint**) by signing the above proof with the associated ed25519 private key of its own **identity server**. A gosling server must verify this signature using the **client's** public key derived from the provided v3 onion service id coinciding with the **client's** own **identity server**.

### Client Authorization Signature Generation and Verification

The client authorization signature is calculated by the **client** by signing the **client's** v3 onion service id with the ed25519 private key derived from the **client's** x25519 private key used to calculate their provided x25519 public key used for client authorization. The **identity server** verifies this signature with the ed25519 public key derived from the **client's** provided x25519 key (used for onion service client authorization).

![client authorization signature](client_auth_signature.svg)

A **client** proves they control the x25519 private key associated with the provided x25519 public key (used for onion service client authorization) by generating the above signature and sending it to the **identity server**. A gosling **identity server** must verify the validity of the provided signature to guarantee the **client** controls the private x25519 key used to derive the provided public x25519 key.
